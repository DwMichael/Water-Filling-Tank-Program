# Water-Filling-Tank-Program
A program that calculates, based on the weather information that it gets from the Api, what will be the 
filling of the tank and adjusts the water level in it to the future weather. If the rainwater causes the tank to overflow,
the program lowers the water from the tank to the appropriate amount so that the tank does not overflow,
if the rainfall exceeds the full capacity of the tank, excess water will be poured out during rainfall.


1. User interface
Before starting the program, the user is required to enter the following values:
- capacity of the purchased tank,
- the minimum water level in the tank to be maintained
- daily water consumption,
- roof surface from which rainwater will be collected,
- the location where the reservoir will be located, in order to collect information on rainfall
